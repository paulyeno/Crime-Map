## Be Safe!


See what areas to avoid, and know when to take extra precautions!

Thank you for taking the time to review and comment on this app and presentation.  

Look favorably upon this Shiny app, and give a good grade to this Coursera student!

In case you didn't pick up on this, graphic design was never my strong suit, but consturctive criticism for this is appreceiated.  Thanks again!
